## Default YaSerde Resource Tests

For the sake of preventing against data loss when serialising and deserialising IEEE 2030.5 resources, tests starting with `default_` belong to a autogenerated test suite for all types defined in the XML XSD. These tests prove the correctness of YaSerde, but do not test for conformance to the IEEE 2030.5 specification.
